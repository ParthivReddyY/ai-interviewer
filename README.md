# 🤖 AI Interviewer

**Revolutionizing technical hiring with intelligent automation**

A sophisticated interview platform that combines advanced AI with intuitive design to create authentic technical interview experiences. Built for the modern hiring landscape, it eliminates scheduling conflicts while maintaining the rigor of traditional technical interviews.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Technical hiring is broken. Coordinating schedules between candidates and interviewers is a nightmare. Manual evaluation is inconsistent. Candidates don't get immediate feedback. Our platform addresses these pain points with a fully automated solution that maintains interview quality while dramatically improving efficiency.

## ⚡ What Makes This Special
